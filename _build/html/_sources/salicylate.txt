Reagents & Equipment
----------------------------

* Colorimeter 
* Cuvettes with caps (preferably macro cuvettes)
* Sodium hydroxide, Carolina Biologicals # 889425
* 6% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach)
* Sodium salicylate, Sigma # S2679-100G
* Sodium nitroferricyanide, Sigma #228710-5G
* 1 mL pipette
* 2 x 100 mL volumetric flasks
* Distilled water

Colorimeter set-up
------------------------

* Wavelength: 625 nm. Red led (colorimeter RGB board) 
* Ammonia standard data: Low-range (0 - 2.5 ppm NH\ :sub:`3`\ ). Download a data file or prepare your own ammonia standard data
* Before measuring blank the colorimeter against water or a distilled water sample developed with Salicylate reagents as described below


Method
---------

Step 1: Prepare fresh reagents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Hypochlorite solution:** 

* Fill a 100 mL volumetric flask with 70 mL of DI water. 
* Add 1 mL of bleach and 0.5 grams of NaOH and mix until dissolved. 
* Fill flask to the 100 mL mark.

**Salicylate/catalyst solution:** 

* Fill a 100 mL volumetric flask with 70 mL of DI water. 
* Add 10 g of sodium salicylate, 0.04 g sodium nitroferricyanide and mix until dissolved. 
* Add 0.5 g of NaOH to adjust pH to the ~12.0 range. 
* Fill flask to the 100 mL mark.  
* Transfer solution into a dark, airtight glass bottle for maximum longevity. Prepare fresh weekly due to limited storage life.

Step 2: Colorimetric assay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Transfer 1 mL of each sample to be tested into a cuvette
* Add 0.25 mL of hypochlorite solution, cap cuvette and invert several times to mix
* Add 0.25 mL of salicylate/catalyst solution, cap cuvette and invert several times to mix
* Let tubes stand for 5-10 mins to develop color.
* Place the cuvette in the colorimeter and click measure. The program will return the ammonia concentration in ppm.
